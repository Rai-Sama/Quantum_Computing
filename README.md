# Topics covered so far
## Quantum bits(qbits) vs Classical bits(cbits)
* Cbits are special cases of qbits
* for a qbit represented by the vector (a  b)<sup>T</sup>; a & b are complex numbers and ||a|<sup>2</sup> + |b|<sup>2</sup>| = 1 and the probability of the qbit collapsing to 0 is |a|<sup>2</sup> and it collapsing to 1 is |b|<sup>2</sup>

## Operations and Gates
* All operations in quantum computing are reversible and inverse of themselves i.e. given the output of an operation it is possible to know what the input was (reversible) and performing the same operation on the output gives the input again (inverse)
* Matrix operators model the effect of some device (like gates) which manipulates qbit spin/polarization without measuring/collapsing it.
* Bitflip: It flips the qbit.
